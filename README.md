Minesweeper-Clone
=================

A little Pygame project

Minesweeper is a well-known computer game famously available for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Many variations exist on many platforms. 

The objective of the game is to click on all of the non-mine blocks. Clicking on a mine block should lead to a game over screen.

Here, I aim to create a simple clone of Minesweeper to introduce myself to basic Pygame modules. 

<h3>TODO:</h3>

<h4>High priority</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Add a game-over state (victory and defeat)</li>
  <li>Have an option to restart the game after the game has ended</li>
  <li>Find a faster way to generate mine-less neighbors (recursion?)</li>
  <li>Add numbers to blocks to signify the number of mine-neighbors (currently using colors)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Low priority</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Time the player</li>
  <li>Keep a record of best times</li>
  <li>Refactor code</li>
</ul>
