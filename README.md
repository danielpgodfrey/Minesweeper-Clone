Minesweeper-Clone
=================

A little Pygame project

Minesweeper is a well-known computer game famously available for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Many variations exist on many platforms. 

The objective of the game is to click on all of the non-mine blocks. Clicking on a mine block should lead to a game-over screen.

This game was inspired by the programarcadegames.com tutorial.

Here, I aim to create a simple clone of Minesweeper to introduce myself to basic Pygame modules. 

NOTE: This game was created for Python3. It requires the pygame library for Python3.
